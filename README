AllTheLittleThings is an addon for World of Warcraft that I created as my way of storing small snippets of code or simply code that was not important enough to stand on its own. This is my recent rewrite, breaking everything up into modules and making it much simpler to extend. While the core was written entirely new, many of the snippets in any module were written a long time ago, so there is more than a fair share of poor lua programming practices floating around.
